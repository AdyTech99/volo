# Volo: Empower Your AI with Wikipedia Knowledge üöÄ

Volo is an innovative solution designed to enhance AI capabilities with Wikipedia knowledge through an efficient **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** pipeline. It utilizes an offline database of Wikipedia powered by **Kiwix**, ensuring fast and reliable access to information without requiring constant internet connectivity.

Volo uses a tiny model (Qwen2.5:3b) and gives it the knowledge of nearly 7 million Wikipedia articles, making it a _more_ reliable source of information than giant closed-source models like OpenAI's GPT4o and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet

By integrating with **Ollama** and supporting **OpenAI-compatible REST APIs**, Volo provides a flexible and user-friendly interface for knowledge-driven AI interactions. Whether you're building intelligent chatbots, conducting research, or just exploring Wikipedia in new ways, Volo makes it seamless and efficient.

## üöÄ Usage

### OpenAI-Compatible API Endpoints

> [!WARNING]
Streaming must be set to __false__ in any custom interface used (like Open WebUI)

Volo provides REST API endpoints compatible with OpenAI:

1.	**/v1/models**: List available models.
2.	**/v1/chat/completions**: Generate AI chat completions.

You can use these endpoints with any OpenAI-compatible client, such as Open WebUI, or your own custom integrations. 
Volo provides a "volo-workflow" model that requests can be made to. When using an interface such as Open WebUI, select the "volo-workflow" model from the dropdown.
The request will be sent through Volo's pipeline, and a result will be produced in the OpenAI format.

### Example API Call

Using curl to make a chat completion request:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:1255/v1/chat/completions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "model": "volo-workflow",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}]
}'
```


## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

Customize Volo by editing the config.ini file:
